# MgfRead.py

Python 3 is required, and you should also install tkinter to run the GUI.

To run it from the script, simply call MgfRead.py with Python:
```sh
python3 MgfRead.py
```

You can also copy the function such as `parse_msconvert` to run it in your own script if you don't need GUI.

To build an `exe` which you can run later without Python, you should install PyInstaller first, and then run:
```sh
build_win.bat # for Windows

sh build_mac.sh # or, for macOS
```
